## Objective
The higher you climb, the more points you receive.

## Controls
The player character cannot be controlled while midair.

While stuck to a platform you can:
- move clockwise around the platform by pressing D or right arrow
- move counter clockwise around the platform by pressing A or left arrow
- jump off the platform by pressing SPACE

If sufficiently close, the character can move between platforms without jumping.

Gravity always points down. This means the character will accelerate downwards while midair (only while midair).
