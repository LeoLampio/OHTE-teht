## Objective
The higher you climb, the more points you receive.

## Controls
The player character cannot be controlled while midair.

While stuck to a platform you can:
- move clockwise around the platform by pressing D or right arrow
- move counter clockwise around the platform by pressing A or left arrow
- jump off the platform by pressing SPACE

If sufficiently close, the character can move between platforms without jumping.

Gravity always points down. This means the character will accelerate downwards while midair.

## Gameover
If the character falls below the window, you gameover.\
Additionally, though there are no walls around the edges of the window, platforms do get deleted outside these bounds.

Due to the platforms being solid objects, the character can get 'squished' between them resulting in a gameover.
